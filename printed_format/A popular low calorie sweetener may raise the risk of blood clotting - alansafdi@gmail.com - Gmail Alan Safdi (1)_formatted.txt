    Sugar substitutes have been around since 1879.
    One of the latest types of sugar substitutes are sugar alcohols,
    such as erythritol.
    Previous research has linked erythritol to cardiovascular issues
    such as heart attack and stroke.
    Researchers have now found that using erythritol may increase a
    person’s risk of blood clots.

    Since the invention of the very first sugar substitute saccharin in
    1879, scientists have been continuing to look for ways to create the
    sweet taste of sugar
    without the calories it has.
    Recently, sugar alcohols have become a common sugar replacement.
    Sugar alcohols tend to be slightly less sweet or equally as sweet as
    natural sugar, allowing
    them to seamlessly replace sugar in some foods.
    One commonly used sugar alcohol is erythritol — a sugar alcohol
    naturally found in certain fruits and vegetables and is commercially
    made through the
    fermentation of a simple sugar called dextrose found in corn.
    Previous research has linked erythritol to an increased risk for
    cardiovascular issues, such as a study published in March 2023 that
    found an association
    between erythritol use and an increased risk for major
    cardiovascular eventsTrusted Source including heart attack and
    stroke.
    “Our earlier studies with erythritol showed in large-scale clinical
    observation studies that elevated blood erythritol levels were
    associated with incident risk of
    myocardial infarction, stroke, and death,” Stanley L. Hazen, MD,
    PhD, chair of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences of the Lerner
    Research Institute and
    co-section head of Preventive Cardiology Cleveland Clinic, who was
    one of the authors of the March 2023 study, told Medical News Today
    in an email.
    He said both animal and blood-based studies indicated that a
    prothrombotic effectTrusted Source with erythritol could explain the
    underlying mechanism.
    Now, Hazen and his colleagues have continued their erythritol
    research with a new study recently published in the journal
    Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and
    Vascular BiologyTrusted Source, reporting that erythritol use may
    also increase a person’s risk of blood clots, which when formed
    inside a blood vessel can
    restrict the movement of blood and oxygen around the body.
    Erythritol consumption raises blood levels by more than 1,000
    times
    For this study, Hazen and his team recruited 20 healthy volunteers —
    non-smokers without cardiovascular disease and no medical history of
    bleeding
    disorders.
    Ten of the volunteers received water mixed with 30 grams of
    glucoseTrusted Source, while the other ten were given water mixed
    with 30 grams of erythritol.
    “The amount of erythritol used is precisely what often is included
    and consumed in processed foods and artificially sweetened
    beverages,” Hazen, who is the
    senior and corresponding author of this study, told Medical News
    Today. “(We) directly tested in humans the effect of erythritol
    ingestion, comparing before vs
    after ingestion in each subject. (We) also directly tested the
    effect of a head-to-head comparison with a sugar-sweetened drink to
    see if glucose caused the same
    effects.”
    Upon analysis, researchers found participants who received
    erythritol experienced an increase in their blood erythritol levels

    Erythritol linked to ‘significant increase’ in blood clot risk
    The researchers also discovered that study participants showed a
    significant increase in their blood platelet activity after
    ingesting erythritol, raising their risk
    of blood clot formation. However, no change was found in the
    participants who consumed glucose.
    “In this small group of healthy volunteers, we show ingesting
    erythritol made platelets more hyper-responsive — that is they show
    a more robust degree of
    activation to a submaximal stimulus, which can raise the risk of
    blood clots,” Hazen explained. “Every subject, for every measurement
    made, at every
    dose/level, showed an increase in clotting potential after drinking
    erythritol. In stark contrast, no change was observed in
    participants after consuming a
    comparable amount of glucose.”
    “What is the significance of this? — it is a public health concern,”
    he continued. “The very subjects most likely to ingest the sugar
    substitute are also often the
    ones most at risk for experiencing a heart attack or stroke. So
    rather than reaching for what one hopes to be a healthy alternative,
    paradoxically, ingesting an
    erythritol-sweetened food or beverage may be increasing a person’s
    risk.”
    Hazen said these findings underscore the importance of further long-
    term clinical studies to reassess the safety of erythritol and other
    sugar substitutes.
    He underscored that people who have an increased risk of thrombosis,
    such as those with conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or
    metabolic syndrome, may
    want to limit the frequency and amount of sugar-sweetened treats
    they consume, and choose them over drinks and foods sweetened with
    these sugar alcohols
    “We plan to explore how broadly the pro-thrombotic effect is in
    alternative sugar substitutes including both alternative sugar
    alcohols and common artificial
    sweeteners,” he added.
    A concerning relationship between erythritol and blood
    clots
    After reviewing this study, Yu-Ming Ni, MD, a board certified
    cardiologist and lipidologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular
    Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain
    Valley, CA, told MNT while this is a small study, it definitely
    suggests some basis for a relationship between erythritol and blood
    clots, which makes him concerned.
    “I think it goes back to all the other sugar substitutes that have
    been invented over the years that have had their own issues,
    concerns with cancerTrusted Source, concerns with
    worsening blood sugar controlTrusted Source because of the extreme
    sweetness of these [artificial] sweeteners,” Ni continued. “So you
    do ask yourself whether just actually

    using sugar is better — just limiting the amount.”

    “I know that for our family, a little bit of sugar is actually
    understandable in certain circumstances,” he added. “I would much
    rather do that or honey or maple syrup rather than use
    [an artificial] sweetener. And I know for myself, I’m definitely
    looking for erythritol in my pantry and getting rid of it.”
