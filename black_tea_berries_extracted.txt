contribute to healthier aging
Higher intakes of black tea, berries, citrus fruits and apples could help to
promote healthy ageing, new research has found.
This study conducted by researchers from Edith Cowan University,
Queen's University Belfast and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
Health, found that foods rich in flavonoids could help to lower the risk of
key components of unhealthy ageing, including frailty, impaired physical
function and poor mental health.
"The goal of medical research is not just to help people live longer but to
ensure they stay healthy for as long as possible," ECU Adjunct Lecturer
Dr Nicola Bondonno said.
"We know from previous research that people who have a higher
flavonoid intake tend to live longer, and they are also less likely to get any
of the major chronic diseases such as dementia, diabetes or heart
disease.
"Our research shows that people who consume more flavonoids tend to
age better."
The study, which analysed data from 62,743 women and 23,687 men
over 24 years, found that women with the highest flavonoid intakes had a
15% lower risk of frailty, a 12% lower risk of impaired physical function,
and a 12% lower risk of poor mental health compared to those with the
lowest intakes. While fewer associations were observed in men, higher
flavonoid intake was still linked to a lower risk of poor mental health.
"Flavonoids are well known for reducing oxidative stress and
inflammation, supporting blood vessel health, and even helping to
maintain skeletal muscle mass — all of which are important for preventing
frailty and maintaining physical function and mental health as we age,"
said senior author, Professor Aedin Cassidy from Queens University
Belfast.
She added that regularly consuming flavonoid-rich foods — such as
berries, apples, red wine, oranges, and tea — could support healthier
aging by reducing the risk of frailty, physical decline, and poor mental
health. The stronger associations observed in women may be due to

differences in follow-up time between the two cohorts rather than true sex-
specific effects, which remain underexplored in existing research.
"We found that participants who increased their intake of flavonoid-rich
food by three servings a day, had a 6% to 11% lower risk across all three
of the ageing outcomes in females, and a 15% lower risk of poor mental
health in males.
"Overall, these findings underscore the potential for simple dietary
modifications to impact overall quality of life and contribute to the
optimisation of healthy aging," added Professor Eric Rimm from Harvard
T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
