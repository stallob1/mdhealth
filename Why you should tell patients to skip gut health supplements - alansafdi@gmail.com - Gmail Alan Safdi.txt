“If you eat fiber, stay hydrated, and manage stress, your
microbiome does the work for you. Most people don’t need extra
supplements unless there’s a diagnosed issue. Don’t fall for the
marketing—your gut isn’t as fragile as they make it seem.”
— Lisa Jones, MA, RDN, LDN, FAND

The global market for digestive health supplements is valued at $13.3
billion—and it's only projected to rise. But while their money market is
rich, not all of these supplements are the best health investments, after
all.[1]
Lisa Jones, MA, RDN, LDN, FAND, a registered dietitian based in
Philadelphia, PA, explains that while some gut health supplements have
benefits, “they’re not magic pills.”
Magic pills?
“Probiotics with well-researched strains, prebiotic fiber, and digestive
enzymes may provide benefits, but only if they’re needed,” Jones
adds. By “needed,” she means if patients are not getting these
cultures and fibers through their food already.

“If you already have a balanced diet, your gut might be just fine without
them,” she says.
To help your patients support their microbiome through nutritious foods,
Jones says you might want to encourage them to add fermented foods to
their diet, such as yogurt, kefir, or kimchi. Don’t forget fiber-rich foods—
also supporters of the microbiome and digestive system—such as beans,
whole grains, and fiber-full veggies.
Utilizing a healthy diet to support your gut can do wonders for your health,
as your microbiome, as a "healthy gut can help reduce inflammation,
improve nutrient absorption, and support overall well-being,” Jones says.

In some cases, patients may be lured by supplements that promise a
“quick fix” for stomach and digestive issues. “Many ‘gut health’
powders, detox teas, and generic probiotic blends are overhyped
and overpriced,” Jones cautions. “Without the right strains or enough
live cultures, they might not do much beyond draining your wallet.”
“The real key is what you eat daily—not just what you supplement,” Jones
adds. “If you eat fiber, stay hydrated, and manage stress, your
microbiome does the work for you. Most people don’t need extra
supplements unless there’s a diagnosed issue. Don’t fall for the marketing
—your gut isn’t as fragile as they make it seem!”
However, patients dealing with gut issues like persistent bloating, irregular
bowel movements, chronic fatigue, or unexplained food sensitivities may
need more help than their diet can offer. In these cases, do what you do
best: Run your regular tests and provide personalized medical advice.
